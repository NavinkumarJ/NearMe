It is a temporary catchment area connected with Chembarambakkam Lake. It is spread over 200 acres with a capacity of 46 million cubic feet (mcft).

                There are four filters working 24x7 to pump water to K. K. Nagar double tank distribution point.[citation needed] Bathing, washing and/or swimming is currently prohibited in this lake from 1995.[citation needed] A better view of the lake can be appreciated from the Chennai bypass.[citation needed]
                
                In 2012, the Water Resources Department initiated a project to increase the capacity the tank along with two other lakes in the city at a cost of â‚¹ 130 crore. This would deepen the lake by at least 1 m and increases the capacity to 70 mcft.[1][2]</p>
